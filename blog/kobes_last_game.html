						<h2>Kobe's Last Game</h2>
						<p>By:Jacob Haddad Tuesday April 4th</p>

					<p>So, here we are. After 20 NBA seasons, 5 NBA Championships, and 2 Olympic Gold Metals, the Black Mamba himself Kobe Bryant is retiring from Basketball. When he entered the league in 1996, his average was around 3 points per game. The following year, he turned it into an almost 20 point average. It wasn’t until 2000 when Kobe and Shaq won their first championship. Then again in 2001, and again in 2002 marking the first 3 peat in the NBA since Jordan and the Bulls in the 90's. </p>
				<p> As you can probably tell I am a huge Lakers fan. Ever since I was born and growing up I saw them win in the early 00’s. They didn’t stop there however, they won back to back again in 2009 and 2010. To be honest, seeing Kobe go is going to be tough. I grew up with him, he was in the league for longer than I’ve been alive. With the same team too, longest person to do so. Seeing him play his last games this Wednesday (4/13/16) will bring a tear to my eye. However, it symbolizes a new beginning. Russell and Randle and the others are showing potential. Who knows who were going to get in this year’s draft? So, as a diehard Lakers fan, goodbye Kobe. Whether it’s #8 or #24, you will be always #1 for me. </p>
