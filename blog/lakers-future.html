						<h2>The Lakers Future</h2>
						<p>By:Jacob Haddad Thursday August 11th</p>
					</header>

					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/russell.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>This seasons NBA free agency has been a wild one. Durant to GSW, Rondo and D-Wade to the Bulls, Rose to NYC, this free agency has been a wild ride. So much talent moved cities, but some hasstayed too. As you know, being a huge Lakers fan, I was excited. While we didnt get much, theres still plenty to be excited about. Let me explain.</p>
				<p>The Lakers have been... lets just say underpreforming the last 3 seasons. Kobe being on his last legs, the whole Chris Paul and Dwight Howard situations, it has not been good. But a fresh new team means a fresh new outlook. Let me explain why the Lakers could be playoff contenders in the next 5 years easily.</p>
				<h2> D'angelo Russell </h2>
				<p>As you know in 2015 the Lakers aquired the #2 pickin that years draft, which we used to aquire D'angelo Russell. We also got Larry Nance Jr later in the draft. Since his first game, he has endured critisism. At one point during the summer league when D'angelo scored 23 points, a team high, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/4ryjba/espn_is_so_critical_of_dangelo/">ESPN said he needed to average 30 points to be considered "good" and kept bringing up his video scandal.</a> Which is not only disrespectful, but just down right bad sportscasting. D'angelo now has something to prove to all these critics. If you compare <a href="https://lakeshowlife.com/2016/02/06/lakers-dangelo-russells-rookie-year-5-comparisons/">D'lo's stats to other superstars rookie seasons, we see that he is on track to be a great player. That of James Harden.</a></p>
